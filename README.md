## Student (K-12 and college students) FERPA optouts:

You will usually have to request a FERPA Opt Out form from the school, fill it out as necessary (making a copy for your own records) and have them place it in your "student file." This is basically a note for secretaries at the school to know that you don't want them to tell inquirers your directory information, which includes name, address, phone numbers, dates of attendance, degrees received, and often some health information including height/weight or other personal details. With the FERPA opt out on file, the details should only then be provided to legitimate employers or law enforcement, or at your request.
